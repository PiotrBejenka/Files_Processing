# Files_Processing_cpp
Application for processing data contained in .txt files.

## ! Program written and tested in Dev-C++ 5.11 !

<br />
  The main file is files_processing.cpp. I wrote it at the beginning of 2018 also as a credit for one of the subjects during my studies. It is used to support a simple database consisting of measuring devices saved in .txt files with their parameters and measurements saved in another file. The tasks performed by the program include the possibility of displaying the devices saved in the database, also listing only selected devices with the selected feature, displaying saved measurements, the possibility of adding new devices and measurements to the database, as well as displaying the measurement result with the assignment to the device and taking into account its features.

  Additionally, I have included the database_creator.cpp program in the repository to create a database with sample values and the resulting .txt files.
